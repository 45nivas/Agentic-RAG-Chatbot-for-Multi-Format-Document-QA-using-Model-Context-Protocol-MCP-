## Sample Workflow (Message Passing with MCP)

**Example scenario:**
```
User uploads: sales_review.pdf, metrics.csv
User asks: "What KPIs were tracked in Q1?"
```

**Complete message flow through professional interface:**
```
➡️ Professional UI (Flask design) forwards to CoordinatorAgent
➡️ CoordinatorAgent orchestrates the pipeline:
   🔸 IngestionAgent → parses documents → sends CHUNKIFY_RESULT
   🔸 RetrievalAgent → finds relevant chunks → sends RETRIEVAL_RESULT  
   🔸 LLMResponseAgent → formats prompt & calls Gemini → sends LLM_ANSWER
➡️ Professional chatbot displays answer with source context in modern interface
```

**MCP message example:**
```json
{
  "type": "RETRIEVAL_RESULT",
  "sender": "RetrievalAgent", 
  "receiver": "LLMResponseAgent",
  "trace_id": "rag-457",
  "payload": {
    "retrieved_context": ["slide 3: revenue up", "doc: Q1 summary..."],
    "query": "What KPIs were tracked in Q1?"
  }
}
```
